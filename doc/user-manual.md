# Welcome! #
You want to animate - and we are here to help. If you don't find the answers you need here, please ask at our [Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/8FxdV2g) or our [forum](https://discuss.pencil2d.org/).

Let's begin...
### Working habits ###
The guidelines we give here are just that. It's a guide. There is no right or wrong way to do things in animation, and when you get more experiences, you will develop your own habits and methods.

Until then you can rely on our recommendations.
## The user interface ##
Before we go to animation, let's have a quick glance at the user interface. 

![Pencil2D User Interface](_manualimages/pencil2dFull.png)

In the top you have the menu bar. Here you can load and save files, import images, add layers and much more.

In the bottom you'll find the time-line, that keeps track of your key-frames. 

To the left and right you'll find dockable windows, where you can select tools, colors, choose settings and more. 

In the middle you have the canvas. The canvas is unlimited in size. The white rectangle in the middle of the canvas, is the camera field. When you open Pencil2D the first time, this size will be 800x600 pixels, but you can change it by double-clicking on the camera layer. *Remember* that the bigger camera field you choose, the more RAM and computer power you use and need.
## Let's animate! ##
Right above the time-line you'll find these buttons. ![Add key-frame](_manualimages/addDeleteKeys.png) Here you can Add, Remove and Duplicate key-frames.

Be sure you are on the bitmap layer and on frame 1. Select the pencil tool, and set its width to 4 or 5. Draw a small circle in the middle of the field.

Go to frame 2. Press the Add key-frame button. Draw a small circle a little to the right of the first one.

Go to frame 3. Press the Add key-frame button. Draw a small circle a little to the right of the second one.

Go to frame 1 again. Press the Play icon, and hooray! - you've made your first animation.

If you find it cumbersome to press Add key-frame every time you want a new key-frame, you can make your life easier. Go to the menu and pick Preferences. Press the Time-line icon. Where it says "When drawing on an empty frame:" you choose the first option "Create a new key-frame". Now, every time you go to an empty frame and start drawing, a new key-frame will be created on that frame.
