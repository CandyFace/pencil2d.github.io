Pencil2D is a not-for-profit, community-driven free and open source project. All the code, documents and website are contributed by our community of volunteers.

There are lots of ways to contribute to the Pencil2D project: coding, testing, improving translations or contributing to the documentation.

# Contributing to the code base

Pencil2D is developed based on **C++** and **Qt framework**. We are happy to receive contributors.
