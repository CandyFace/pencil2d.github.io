**Pencil2D** is a not-for-profit, community-driven free and open source project. All the code, documents and website are contributed by our community of volunteers.

There are lots of ways to contribute to Pencil2D project: coding, testing, improving translations or contributing to the documentation. You can help improve Pencil2D, too!

# Report a bug

One of the easiest and most effective ways you can help improve Pencil2D is reporting bugs. You can report bugs and make feature requests in our **[Issue Tracker][3]**. The [Pencil2D Issue Tracker][3] contains a list of pending tasks across a variety of topics, information, and progress on those tasks, including which ones our developer are working on at the moment.

# Help Translate Pencil2D

Pencil2D has been translated into 11 languages by our generous volunteer translators from all over the world.
You can translate Pencil2D to your language by joining us on [Transifex][4], a online translation collaboration platform.

# Contributing to the code base

Pencil2D is written in **C++** and **Qt framework**. If you know C++ or you want to learn C++, this would be a good way to go. We are always happy to receive contributors.

The source code can be obtained from [Github][0] and you can find development documents [here][1].

If you have any difficulties getting involved or finding answers to your questions, please bring those questions to the [discord chat room][5] so that we can help you get started.
