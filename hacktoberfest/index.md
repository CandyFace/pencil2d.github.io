**Hacktoberfest** is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean and DEV taking place every October. Every year we take this opportunity to welcome potential Pencil2D contributors and to reward them for helping us to make Pencil2D better!

Our greatest need is for developers, but we also have tasks for people to participate in this event even if they do not know how to program. We have created a guide for both of these groups of contributors to help people get started with Hacktoberfest. Please choose the appropriate guide for your skills if you are interested in learning more:
