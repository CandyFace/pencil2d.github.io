Hello, friends of Pencil2D,

Christmas is getting close, and it’s about time to unwrap one of the early presents for you.
So yes, it has finally happened: Pencil2D 0.6 released today! You can get it from http://pencil2d.github.io/download/.

Let’s unwrap it a little bit, and take a look at what’s inside.

## 0.6 is much more stable than 0.5.4

Thanks to all the [contributors], there are tons of bugs have been fixed in the 0.6. We can say with confidence that Pencil2D 0.6 is more stable than old 0.5.4. Now you can simply enjoy animating without worrying too much about losing your work.

The development team is still working hard to make Pencil2D more stable. Please don't hesitate to [tell us] if you encounter any issues. Your report will help Pencil2D get better.

## Color Wheel


## Colored Onion skins

Hard to know what are in previous or next frames? Display the onion skins of “previous frames” as **red** and the onion skins of "next frames" as **blue** to see them clearly.

## Export your animation to mp4, avi or gif

Finally, the movie export is working. Go to the menu → File → Export and export your animation to the following formats: animated gif, avi, mp4 or wmv.

## Timeline Improvements

- select/deselect a single frame (LMB).
- select a range of frames (Shift + LMB).
- select/deselect individual frames (Ctrl +LMB)
- select a frame and all the frames after it (Alt + LMB)
- box select (Alt +LMB)
- move a single frame (LMB Selected + Drag)
- move a frame and all the frames at its right (Alt + LMB +Drag)
- Implementation of relative/absolute Onion Skin functionality.

## More features and improvements

- Dynamically change brush feather by Ctrl + Drag Left/Right.
- Rotate selection area (Ctrl + Drag Left/Right): Left rotate anticlockwise, right rotate clockwise. The Move tool(Q) should be selected before applying this hotkey.

## Known issue

- At the moment you can undo a “frame deletion”, but cannot redo it.
