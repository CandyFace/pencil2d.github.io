# Getting Started

If you were planning on joining **Hacktoberfest** by coding your way into T-shirt paradise, why not help Pencil2D while you're at it?

This page contains an quick overview of what Hacktoberfest is and how to get started:

> What is Hacktoberfest?
> Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio.

> + Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!
> + Five quality pull requests must be submitted to public GitHub repositories.
> + You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

+ To learn more about how to participate in the Hacktoberfest event please visit their **FAQ**: https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/faq
+ Remember that to participate **you have to register at Digital Ocean's website with your Github account**, read the relevant details on their site.

# Pencil2D's Developer's Guide(s)

+ To learn how to get started with Pencil2D's codebase please visit our dedicated [Pencil2D Documentation Page](https://www.pencil2d.org/pencil-docs/docs/) or our [Github Developer Wiki](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/wiki)

# Comitting to Pencil2D: Recommended Issues

+ The Pencil2D team has prepared a [Hacktoberfest label](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/labels/hacktoberfest) in the Pencil2D repository for recommended issues that should be possible to implement during the duration of this event.
+ If all the recommended issues have been claimed, we welcome you to browse through our [Enhancement label](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/labels/enhancement) which also has important quality of life improvements for the project and which may have a similar level of difficulty as the event label, just be prepared to dip yourself more into the code!
+ You can also keep track of the [Hacktoberfest Milestone](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/milestone/7) for limited-time only! (remember due date is OCt 31st!)

# Github Repository (N)ettiquete

+ **To avoid duplicate work** from participants that want to implement the same issues, we advice you to _"claim"_ an issue by commenting on the issue(s) you want to work on. Task assignment will be handled on a first come, first serve basis! But make sure you explicitly mention you will be working on it for Hacktoberfest so we can keep track of it.
