After 6 months of work, we're finally ready to wrap up the version 0.6.3 with new features, enhancements and bug fixes that have been worked on by the community. [Please download it here][0] and enjoy animating.

Many of these fixes and enhancements were made possible by contributors around the world that learned of our project through the [#Hacktoberfest2018](https://www.pencil2d.org/2018/10/hacktoberfest-pencil2d.html) event sponsored by [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and [Github](https://github.com)

To everyone that contributed and made this release possible. Thank you!

## Flipping / Rolling
[#1131](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/pull/1131) (by [davidlamhauge][david])

Flipping & Rolling are two techniques that allow animators to quickly preview their animation work.

Flipping is used mostly for the process known as in-betweening with 3 drawings. By pressing `Alt+Z`, you can glance through the first drawing (previous key), the last drawing (next key) and the currently edited inbetween.

Rolling technique is used to check a specific part of the action of the animation. By pressing `Alt+X`, you can preview 5 drawings in ordered sequence flipping with all your available fingers.

## Known Issues

- [#1033](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1033) Sound import and playback does not work with the Linux AppImage. Workaround: use the [flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.pencil2d.Pencil2D) or your distro package manager (if it offers the latest version).
- [#940](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/pull/940) Possibly unfixed: project corrupted because comma is used as decimal separator in some places instead of period.
- [#1133](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1133) Lag and buggy strokes with Huion tablets. Workaround: disabling the "linear optimizer" in your tablet driver may help if that option is available, see [this post](https://discuss.pencil2d.org/t/difficulty-with-tablet/1369/9?u=scribblemaniac).
- [#748](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/748), [#1004](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1004), [#1120](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1120), [#1170](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1170), [#1098](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1098) Miscellaneous undo/redo issues. Should hopefully be fixed in v0.6.5.
- [#1019](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1019) The program may crash or erase content on Windows when using the `ALT + TAB / APPLE + TAB / SHIFT + TAB` shortcut.
- [#1174](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1174) Inconsistent palette import behavior: Depending on which palette file format is used, the new palette may append or overwrite the existing palette.
- [#1117](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1117) Issue 4: The CLI (Command-Line Interface) export operation consumes more memory than exporting from within the editor itself.
- [#1120](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1120) Undoing Selection Flip X / Y will delete the drawing instead.
- [#1177](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1177) Imported image position is modified by the canvas view center
- [#1179](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1179) Currently there's an audio delay of 1-2 frames for in-editor playback & exported files. However on some systems the opposite happens where the audio delay on playback might be longer by 12-16 or more frames, but on export it works ok.
- [#1186](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1186) Quick Sizing is enabled on Paint Bucket Tool, but does nothing.
- [#1189](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/1189) Zoom shortcut on drawing tools not working with the mouse (macOS)
- Playing back audio from any frame other than the first will slightly off-sync the audio in the editor. For now we recommend playing back from the beginning and gauging the sound particularly for lipsync or musicalized action.

- Color Palette (Bitmap): First Swatch is unchangeable. Can’t use replace command. Use the other swatches to create your own colors or change it by editing the palette in a vector layer or via XML.
- Color Palette (Bitmap): Swatches will only update using the Replace command when having a vector layer active. (Note: Create your custom palettes with a vector layer selected)
- Selection Tool (Rotation): Using the SELECT ALL command (CTRL + A) and rotating a selection, will store the rotation transformation, if you create a selection and click on the drawing with the MOVE TOOL, it will rotate the selection again. Despite possible use cases this is a bug.
- Undo: Undoing a drawing modification made on an empty frame creates a keyframe on that frame.
- Undo: Undoing moving a keyframe to a new frame will create a blank keyframe on the place where it used to be.
- Undo, Smudge Tool (Bitmap): You cannot UNDO the smudge tool at the moment.
- Blur Tool (Bitmap): Pressing ALT with smudge tool doesn’t work, do not use it. Use other drawing apps for smudge effects.
- Fill Tool (Vector): Filling a stroke requires the stroke to be selected.
- Fill Tool (Vector): “stroke thickness” option will reset pressure sensitive lines width.
- In general the Vector Engine is a WIP or not working as intended. Much more work will be required, please don't use it.
