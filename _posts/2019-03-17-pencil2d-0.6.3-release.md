## Flipping / Rolling

Flipping & Rolling are two techniques that allow animators to quickly preview their animation work.

Flipping is used mostly for the process known as in-betweening with 3 drawings. By pressing `Alt+Z`, you can glance through the first drawing (previous key), the last drawing (next key) and the currently edited inbetween.

Rolling technique is used to check a specific part of the action of the animation. By pressing `Alt+X`, you can preview 5 drawings in ordered sequence flipping with all your available fingers.
