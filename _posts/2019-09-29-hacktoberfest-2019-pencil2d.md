We are pleased to be accepting Hacktoberfest 2019 participants this year and we are calling on everyone to use this opportunity to help improve Pencil2D while getting a chance to earn a free t-shirt! (woo!) 

We are always in need of C++ / Qt developers, but even if you have no programming experience you may still be able to help us in other ways, so read on!

# Getting Started

**What is Hacktoberfest?**

_**Hacktoberfest** is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean and DEV._
+ Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community.
+ To participate, four pull requests must be submitted to public GitHub repositories.
+ You can sign up anytime between **October 1st** and **October 31st**. 
+ PR’s will be due on October 31st!

**How do I Join?**
1. First, register at http://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com 
2. Then, visit our Github repository at https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/
3. Submit at least four PRs (Pull Requests) to our repository. You can look for open issues labeled [**Hacktoberfest**](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahacktoberfest) for inspiration. Quality contributions are encouraged!

_**Note:** Contributions can be made to any public repository. While it doesn’t have to be ours, we would be very happy if you decide to work with us. ;-)_

# Pencil2D's Developer Guides

To learn how to get started with Pencil2D's codebase please the following links:
+ [Pencil2D Documentation Page](https://www.pencil2d.org/pencil-docs/docs/) _Here you'll find development setup guides for all major OS, as well as the Doxygen generated documentation from source comments._
+ [Github Developer Wiki](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/wiki) _This is a mirror of the Pencil2D docs, use it if the other link is not working for you, or viceversa._

# Pencil2D's User Guides

We also have a work-in-progress front-end for our users where you should find how to use Pencil2D.
+ [User Manual](https://www.pencil2d.org/doc/user-manual.html) _A WIP effort to write a simple hands-on guide to learn the basic usage of Pencil2D._

+ [FAQ](https://www.pencil2d.org/doc/faq.html) _Frequently Asked Questions; need an update._

## Recommended Issues

We have different ways of interacting with the repository issues
1. We have a [Hacktoberfest label](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahacktoberfest) for issues that new developers should be able to implement during the duration of this event.
2. If those issues are claimed, or do not interest you, we suggest you browse through our [Enhancement label](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/labels/enhancement). This label has important quality of life improvements for the project and may have a similar level of difficulty Hacktoberfest issues, just be prepared to dip yourself more into the code! 
3. For seasoned developers that want to continue supporting the project we can also recommend the [request: core](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/labels/request%3A%20core) and the [bug](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/labels/bug) labels.

_**Note:** You are not required to choose only from the suggested issues that carry these labels, any valid pull request that you submit will count towards your prize._

# I Can't Program, How Can I Participate?

Don't worry there are other things you help us with:
- We are in need of **documentation contributions** to help new users learn the ropes of Pencil2D. Please visit our [Pencil2D website repository](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil2d.github.io), and read the documentation [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil2d.github.io/tree/master/doc/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for a detailed guide on how to contribute to our different documentation media.
- We're interested in high quality animation files to **demo** key features of the the software. If you are an animator and are interested in helping with this, contact us to se which features are prone to be demoed.
- If you are fluent in a foreign language you can help by **translating** and **proofreading** the messages in Pencil2D into your language. You can find and help with our translations on the [Transifex platform](https://www.transifex.com/pencil2d/pencil2d/).
- If you are experienced with **web development**, our website also has an open source repository [available here](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil2d.github.io). It is a static website so we don't have many things to work on for it at the moment, but have a look around our site and let us know if there is something you think you can improve upon.
- Get creative! Think about what you are good at and if you can use skills to help us in any way. 
  - Are you an artist? Maybe you can make create mockups for parts of our interface. 
  - Work in advertising? Maybe you can provide some suggestions for marketing our software. 
  - Even simple things like spreading the word on social media or thanking the developers can be more helpful than you think (although these won't help you get the t-shirt ;-) ).

_For additional details on any of these points please contact us on one of our official channels (see [Getting Help](https://www.pencil2d.org/2019-09-29-hacktoberfest-2019-pencil2d#getting-help))._

# Tracking our progress

Visit our [Hacktoberfest Milestone](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/milestone/10) for limited-time only to see what work has been done for Hacktoberfest!

# Github Repository (N)ettiquete

**To avoid duplicate work** from participants that want to implement the same issues, we highly recommend the following:
+ On _Github_ you have to _"claim"_ an issue by commenting on the issue(s) you want to work on in. Task assignment will be handled on a first come, first serve basis. Make sure you explicitly mention you will be working on it for **Hacktoberfest** so we can keep track of it.

+ If you want to work on a **feature** or **fix** that does not have a corresponding issue, please **submit one before starting** to get input from our main developers and avoid duplicate or unnecessary work.

+ If two people do end up submitting pull requests for fixing the same feature, both will count towards your Hacktoberfest progress, but we will probably only use the better of the two implementations. 

+ If any submission is identical to a previously submitted PR, the PR that was submitted later will be considered to be plagiarized and will not count towards your Hacktoberfest progress.

+ For general behavior, please abide by [our code of conduct](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). TL;DR: Be nice to everyone.
