We just released a hotfix version for a Unicode filename issue found recently on Windows. It fixes a failure of opening a `.pclx` which has Unicode characters in filenames. Please download the new builds from our [Download]({{ "/download" | relative_url }}) Page.

Please note, this issue is Windows only. Mac & Linux versions are not affected.
