We are pleased to be accepting Hacktoberfest participants again this year and we are calling on everyone to use this opportunity to help improve Pencil2D while getting a chance to earn a free T-shirt! (woo!) 

We are always in need of C++ / Qt developers, but even if you have no programming experience you may still be able to help us in other ways, so read on!

We've created two guides to contributing to Pencil2D for Hacktoberfest, one for coders and one for everyone else looking to help. We have jobs from making new features and fixing bugs, to improving our website, to helping create the user documentation or translating and proofreading our application. Please check out one or both of these if you want to learn more:
