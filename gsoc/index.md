Hello and welcome! Here is where you can find everything you need to know about
helping Pencil2D for the 2019 Google Summer of Code program. If you are not
familiar with the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program, it is a summer program
that encourages students to get involved with open source development. Our
approval for the program is still pending but we hope that it will bring new
talent to our project and provide us with an opportunity to share our passion
for open source software and animation with a new generation of programmers.
You can find out more details about the program at
[http://g.co/gsoc](http://g.co/gsoc).

# Applying as a Student

If our organization application is accepted this year, students will have until
April 9th to submit a proposal to us. For details of the proposal, see our
