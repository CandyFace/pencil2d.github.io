**Getting Started**
This page contains a list of potential project ideas that we are keen to develop during GSoC 2018. If you would like to apply as a GSoC student, please follow these three steps to get started:

+ Read through this page and identify the project ideas you find interesting. Play around with our tools!
+ Check out our application tips.
+ Join us on Discord and talk to your potential mentors:

## Application Tips

You'll be following GSoC's application process [instructions](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/). And we'll be asking you to make at least one small initial pull request before the application deadline (3 April 2018), to help us assess you as a developer.

> Getting started earlier is better, so you have more time to learn, make contributions, and make a good proposal.

Your application should include the following:

+ Details on any experience you have related to the technologies that Pencil2D has, or related to our product approach.
+ Links to materials to help us evaluate your level of experience and how you work, such as personal projects of yours, including any existing open source or open culture contributions you've made and any bug reports you've submitted to open source projects.
+ Some notes on what you are hoping to get out of your twelve-week project.
+ A description of the project you'd like to do, and why you're excited about it.
+ Some notes on why you're excited about working on Pencil2D.
+ A link to the small initial contribution(s) you did.
+ We expect applicants to either have experience with the technologies relevant to their project or have strong programming experience. We also expect applicants to be excited about learning how to do disciplined, professional software engineering, where they can demonstrate through reasoning and automated tests that their code is correct.

While only one contribution is required to be considered for the program, we find that the strongest applicants make multiple contributions throughout the application process, including after the application deadline.

We are more interested in candidates if we see them submitting good contributions to Pencil2D projects, helping other applicants on GitHub, on IRC and in Discord, learning from our suggestions, trying to solve their own obstacles and then asking well-formed questions, and developing and sharing project ideas and project proposals that are plausible and useful.

Also, you're going to find that people give you links to pages that answer your questions. Here's how that often works:

1. you try to solve your problem until you get stuck, including looking through our code and our documentation, then start formulating your request for help
2. you ask your question
3. someone directs you to a document
4. you go read that document, and try to use it to answer your question
5. you find you are confused about a new thing
6. you ask another question
7. now that you have demonstrated that you have the ability to read, think, and learn new things, someone has a longer talk with you to answer your new specific question
8. you and the other person collaborate to improve the document that you read in step 3 :-)
9. This helps us make a balance between person-to-person discussion and documentation that everyone can read, so we save time answering common questions but also get everyone the personal help they need. This will help you understand the rhythm of help we provide in the developers Discord chat -- including why we prefer to give you help in our public repository and mailing lists, instead of in one-on-one private messages or email. We prefer to hear from you and respond to you in public places so more people have a chance to answer the question, and to see and benefit from the answer.

## Mentors
Experienced members of Pencil2D's core team are interested in mentoring these projects. We usually decide which contributors are mentoring which projects based in part on who is a good fit for the needs of each student as well as technical expertise. You can reach us via #pencil2d on the Pencil2D IRC node, on our Discord server in the #GSoC channel, on the Github repository or through our GSoC mailing list, and we'll gladly help you out.

Pencil2D contributing mentors are experts that can be suitable for various projects, we're sure they will be able to provide you with the nurturing feedback on your proposal. Also be mindful that Pencil2D operates under group mentorship. That means you can contact anyone, not just the person assigned to you, for assistance. Our preferred approach is to just post in either of the above mentioned channels for someone to help you as quick as possible. 

It is important that you demonstrate your skills by contributing to an open source project like Pencil2D so you can:
+ Show that you can work effectively in a large codebase (it doesn't matter what part of Pencil2D, and we're happy to consider work in other open source projects).
+ Test your work before submitting for review. To us quality is more important than quantity. 
+ Follow our [coding guidelines]() (and don't worry if you make mistakes in your first few contributions! Everyone makes mistakes getting started).

Once you have several PRs merged (or at least one significant PR merged), you should start discussing with the Pencil2D development community the project you'd like to do, and developing a specific project plan. We recommend discussing what you're thinking in public streams on chat.Pencil2D.org, so it's easy to get quick feedback from whoever is online.

## Project Ideas Overview
For any of the proposed project you will need to research Pencil2D codebase, read GitHub issues to understand how the project has evolved, and talk with developers to put together a complete project proposal. It's also fine for you to come up with your own project ideas. The projects proposed below stem from key areas that we'd like to improve after taking into account our users and other developers insight.

To assist you in finding a great project to challenge your abilities, we list the skills that are required, but also try to emphasize where strong skills with particular tools are likely to be critical for any given project.

## GSoC 2018 Project Ideas

###Project Idea #1

`GSoC Note: Depending on how your organization operates, the source of material for your Ideas Page may come from an existing list of projects maintained by your community year-round, from potential mentors as they are recruited, or from the org admin. Regardless of how it is generated, an Ideas Page should have the following:`

+ `Brief descriptions of projects that can be completed in about 12 weeks.`
+ `For each project, a list of prerequisites, description of programming skills needed and estimation of difficulty level.`
+ `A list of potential mentors.`
+ `It must NOT be a link to your bug tracker.`

+ **Mentor** Matt Chang (chchwy) 
+ **Backup Mentor** Mentor Real Name (scribblemaniac)
+ **Skills required** C++, QT, etc (fill in according to the project)
+ **Project Category** New Feature / Existing Feature Enhancement / Other (e.g something like improving developer documentation?)
+ **Project Core Objective** Library that can be attached to a network stream to identify the protocols in use. 
+ **Description** 
What needs to be done (simple description of the project; requirements)
How it could be done (rough programming ideas, algorithm suggestions, suggested lectures or readings on topic). 
Why it should be done (ie. How does it benefit the project?)
How it is aligned with Pencil2D's vision (Project Purpose Check)

##Sharing proposals (February-April 2018)
_Students Guide_
If you're applying to GSoC, we'd like for you to publicly post a few sections of your proposal like:
+ Your Project Summary
+ Requirements: This is a simple description of the project; Think of What needs to be done and what would be requirements for it.
+ Base Roadmap: Explain how do you think it can be done (rough programming ideas, algorithm suggestions, suggested lectures or readings on a specific topic can be cited to make your proposal clear). 
+ Benefit & Purpose: Why do you think it should be done and How do you think this project is aligned with Pencil2D's vision (ie. How does it benefit the project as a whole? both technically and philosophically)
+ List of Estimated Deliverables
+ Rough Development Timeline Estimate

This should be posted publicly on the Web, before the recommended due date(s). That way, the developer community, not just the mentors and organization administrators, can have a chance to provide you with feedback in order to help you improve your proposal. You can publish it in any service as long as:

+ Allows simple access for you and the general public 
+ Allows easy content editing and update
+ Allows the development community to make suggestions

Once you have the idea down start a new email thread (on the Pencil2D GSoC email list) with a link to what you've written, and we'll start giving you feedback! And don't worry about delivering a perfect write up at first. You can start your proposal with a simple rough for your first draft while improving and "refactoring" until you're satisfied.

We hope to hear from you! And in behalf of everyone in the Pencil2D team we thank you for being interested in this wonderful project. We're always happy to help volunteers get started contributing in our open source project!
