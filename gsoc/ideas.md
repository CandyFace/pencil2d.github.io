## Getting Started
This page contains a list of potential project ideas that we are keen to develop during GSoC 2018. If you would like to apply as a GSoC student, please follow these three steps to get started:

+ Read through this page and identify the project ideas you find interesting. Play around with our tools!
+ Check out our 
+ Join us on our dedicated channels and talk to your potential mentors, so everyone can learn and benefit from these interactions:
  + [Pencil2D's public Github repository]()
  + [Pencil2D IRC Channel #pencil2D]()
  + [![Pencil2D Discord](/images/Discord-Logo+Wordmark-Color.png)](https://discord.gg/4PCtGXq)

## Mentors

Pencil2D contributing mentors are working professionals that are suitable for various projects, and we're sure they will be able to provide you with the nurturing feedback you require for your proposal. Mentors for each project are selected based on their technical expertise and how it fits best a given project while taking into consideration the needs of each student. Be mindful that Pencil2D operates under group mentorship. That means you can contact anyone that is part of Pencil2D's core team for assistance, not just the person directly assigned to you. For this you can post in either of the above mentioned channels for someone to help you as quick as possible. 

It is important that you demonstrate your skills by contributing to an open source project like Pencil2D so you can:
+ Show that you can work effectively in a large codebase (it doesn't matter what part of Pencil2D, and we're happy to consider work in other open source projects).
+ Test your work before submitting for review. To us quality is more important than quantity. 
+ Follow and participate on our [coding guidelines discussion](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/issues/683) to make sure Pencil2D has a clean and easy to understand source code (and don't worry if you make mistakes in your first few contributions! Everyone makes mistakes getting started).

Once you have several PRs merged (or at least one significant PR merged), you should start discussing with the Pencil2D development community the project you'd like to do, and developing a specific project plan. We recommend discussing what you're thinking in public streams on chat.Pencil2D.org, so it's easy to get quick feedback from whoever is online.

## Project Ideas Overview
For any of the proposed project you will need to research Pencil2D codebase, read GitHub issues to understand how the project has evolved, and talk with developers to put together a complete project proposal. It's also fine for you to come up with your own project ideas. The projects proposed below stem from key areas that we'd like to improve after taking into account our users and other developers insight.

To assist you in finding a great project to challenge your abilities, we list the skills that are required, but also try to emphasize where strong skills with particular tools are likely to be critical for any given project.

## GSoC 2018 Project Ideas

### Project Idea #1

```javascript
//Project Description Template
//GSoC 2018 Note: Depending on how your organization operates, the source of material for your Ideas Page may come from an existing list of projects maintained by your community year-round, from potential mentors as they are recruited, or from the org admin. Regardless of how it is generated, an Ideas Page should have the following:

//+ Brief descriptions of projects that can be completed in about 12 weeks.
//+ For each project, a list of prerequisites, description of programming skills needed and estimation of difficulty level.
//+ A list of potential mentors.`
//+ It must NOT be a link to your bug tracker.
```

+ **Mentor** Matt Chang (chchwy) 
+ **Backup Mentor** Mentor Real Name (scribblemaniac)
+ **Skills required** C++, QT, etc (fill in according to the project)
+ **Project Category** New Feature / Existing Feature Enhancement / Other (e.g something like improving developer documentation?)
+ **Project Core Objective** Library that can be attached to a network stream to identify the protocols in use. 
+ **Description** 
  + What needs to be done (simple description of the project; requirements)
  + How it could be done (rough programming ideas, algorithm suggestions, suggested lectures or readings on topic). 
  + Why it should be done (ie. How does it benefit the project?)
  + How it is aligned with Pencil2D's vision (Project Purpose Check)
